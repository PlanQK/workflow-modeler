# Workflow Events
The Quantum Workflow Modeler dispatches [Custom HTML Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events)
when the workflow of the modeler changes. The event types the modeler creates are defined in [workflowEventTypes](../../../../components/bpmn-q/modeler-component/editor/EditorConstants.js)
Currently four Events are dispatched:
- LOADED: ('quantum-workflow-loaded'), when a new workflow is loaded in modeler
- SAVED: ('quantum-workflow-saved'), when a workflow is saved
- TRANSFORMED: ('quantum-workflow-transformed'), when a workflow was transformed
- DEPLOYED: ('quantum-workflow-deployed'), when a workflow was deployed to the workflow engine

Each Event contains the workflow as xml string and the file name of the current workflow as entries of detail. The event 
is structured like this:
````javascript
const newEvent = new CustomEvent(type, {
    detail: {
        workflowName: workflowName, // name of the current loaded workflow
        workflow: workflowXml // the currently loaded workflow as an xml string
    },
    cancelable: true
});
````

## Event Handler
The dispatching of the events are controlled by the [EditorEventHandler](../../../../components/bpmn-q/modeler-component/editor/events/EditorEventHandler.js).
Use this class to dispatch a workflow Event via the ```dispatchWorkflowEvent()``` function or add a listener for the 
workflow events with ````addWorkflowEventListener()````.

The workflow events can be used to also handle the changes of the workflow in the web app which integrates the modeler. Therefore,
the can register an event listener on the modeler component to catch the workflow events, like in the following example:
````javascript
const modelerComponent = document.querySelector('quantum-workflow-modeler');

modelerComponent.addEventListener('quantum-workflow-loaded', (event) => {
    console.log('------------------------------------------------');
    console.log('Received loaded quantum workflow ' + event.detail.workflowName + ':')
    console.log('------------------------------------------------');

}, false);
````

You can control the handling of the transformed workflow by your application instead by the modeler. Therefore, you register a listener
for the ````quantum-workflow-transformed```` event and call ````preventDefault()```` on the event. The modeler will recognize that and will not handle the transformed 
workflow. The following example shows how to do that:
````javascript
modelerComponent.addEventListener('quantum-workflow-transformed', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const name = event.detail.workflowName;
    const workflow = event.detail.workflow;

    // handle transformed workflow
    
});
````
