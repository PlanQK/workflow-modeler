# Using the Pattern Plugin: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to use the Pattern Plugin in the workflow modeler:

## 1. Access the Plugin
Begin by clicking on the "Pattern Plugin" within the workflow modeler.

## 2. Navigate to Pattern Selection
Once the plugin interface opens, locate and click on the "Open Pattern Selection" button.

## 3. Browse Available Patterns
In the pattern selection window, you'll find a variety of patterns organized into categories:
- Algorithm Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns
- Augmentation Patterns

## 4. Select Algorithm Pattern
Choose the "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)" from the algorithm patterns list.

## 5. Choose Augmentation Pattern
Additionally, select the "Biased Initial State" pattern from the augmentation patterns.

## 6. Confirm Selection
After making your pattern choices, confirm your selection to proceed.

## 7. Automatic Solution Check
The plugin will automatically verify if a solution exists for the selected patterns:
- If a solution is found, it will be retrieved and integrated into a subprocess.
- If no solution is found, the subprocess will remain empty, allowing you to start your modeling from scratch.

**Note**: You can add additional patterns to your solution by dragging and dropping them from the palette.
