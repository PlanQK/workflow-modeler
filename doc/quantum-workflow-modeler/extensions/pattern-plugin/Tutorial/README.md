# Tutorial

In the following, it is described how to use the pattern plugin

1. Start by clicking on the "Pattern Plugin" in your system interface.

2. Once the plugin opens, look for the "Open Pattern Selection" button.

3. In the pattern selection window, you'll find various patterns categorized as QAOA, Algorithm Patterns, and Behavioral Patterns.

4. Select the "QAOA" pattern to specify the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.

5. Additionally, choose a pattern from the "Algorithm Patterns" and "Behavioral Patterns" sections based on your workflow requirements.

6. Confirm your pattern selection.

7. The plugin will automatically check if a solution exists for the chosen patterns.

8. If a solution is found, it will be retrieved and integrated into the subprocess. In case no solution exists, the subprocess will remain empty, allowing you to start your modeling from scratch. If you want to add patterns after your solution then you can drag and drop them from the palette.

9. Then you can transform the workflow.
