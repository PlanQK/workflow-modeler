# Pattern Plugin
Plugin which integrates the patterns as a plugin. Explore the [Tutorial](./Tutorial/README.md) for a brief example demonstrating how to use the plugin.

### Pattern Overview
The pattern selection enables to automatically generate quantum workflows based on implementations connected to the selected patterns. Thereby, three different types of pattern exist: The algorithm patterns specify which algorithms should be executed within the quantum workflow. The behavioral patterns determine the execution strategy for the chosen algorithms, e.g., by using a hybrid runtime. The augmentation patterns enable the enhancement of the quantum workflow by incorporating additional features or elements, such as warm-starting or circuit cutting. Further information about usable patterns can be found on this [website](https://www.quantumcomputingpatterns.org).
