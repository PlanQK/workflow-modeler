# DataMapObjects rules
The DataMapObjects can not be used together with the Loop, Parallel or Sequential BPMN marker. Therefore the rules for connecting DataMapObjects block incoming connections from tasks with one of these markers. Also DataMapObjects can not be used with BPMN Collection, so the respectiv marker is removed in the Camunda PopupHedaer for DataMapObjects
